## Layering

```
src/app/       Routes only — pages and API handlers. No business logic.
src/features/  Client UI, one folder per tool. `features/shared/` holds
               cross-feature client pieces.
src/shared/    Domain logic and the API contract, one folder per concern.
               Never UI.
```

Two rules are easy to get wrong, and both are load-bearing:

- **`shared/` must never import from `features/`.** The reverse is fine. The
  direction is what keeps server-side domain code out of the client bundle.
- **Import from a folder's barrel `index.ts`, not its internals**
  (`@/features/shared`, not `@/features/shared/account`). Add new exports to the
  barrel. A module that only the barrel's own siblings build on stays out of it —
  `local-store.ts` is the current example.

`src/shared/contract/` is the seam between the two: types only, zero runtime
imports, so a `"use client"` module can import from it without pulling a database
client into the browser.

Path aliases: `@/*` → `src/*`, plus `@thelab/http` → `src/shared/http`. The second
exists only so a file ported from TheLabX needs no edit to that import; new code
here should write `@/shared/http`.

`allowImportingTsExtensions` is on, for the same reason it is in TheLabX: tests
run under Node's own runner (`npm test`), which resolves the file it is given.
Extensions therefore follow a rule rather than a habit:

- Alias imports (`@/…`, `@thelab/http`) — **never** carry `.ts`.
- Ordinary relative imports in a runtime module — **no** extension.
- A test importing the module under test — **explicit `.ts`**.

`npm test` needs Node ≥ 22.6 for `--experimental-strip-types`; on 23.6+ the flag
is redundant but harmless.

## Reaching Sleeper

Four `shared/` concerns stack, and the order is the whole design:

```
shared/http     fetch + bounded retry. Knows nothing about Sleeper.
shared/sleeper  the client, the process-wide concurrency bound, the 404 rule.
shared/season   which season "now" means, resolved rather than compiled in.
shared/user     a typed name -> a Sleeper user, memoized.
```

**`shared/http` is native `fetch`, where TheLabX uses axios + axios-retry behind
a `@thelab/http` alias.** This app carries no runtime dependency outside React
and Next, and axios-retry's ladder — three retries on top of a 30s timeout each,
`shouldResetTimeout` and all — is up to ~141s of a request's life re-dialling an
upstream, which `shared/season` documents as the thing that made a cold season
resolve unacceptable in front of a request. The *contract* is kept identical so a
port back would touch no caller: `http.get<T>(url)` resolves to a `{ data }`
envelope, and a non-2xx throws with `response.status` — which is all
`sleeper/missing` reads.

The retry ladder is the part of it to distrust: hand-rolled, where axios-retry
has been wrong in production and fixed. `http.test.ts` pins the decisions that
are silent when wrong — a 404 and a 429 are final, a 5xx and a timeout are not,
and a caller's abort ends the ladder even when it fires *during* a backoff rather
than during an attempt.

**Every Sleeper call goes through `sleeperGet`, and that is why the concurrency
bound can.** Local per-caller bounds do not add up; the one in
`sleeper/limiter.ts` is per process. Two functions rather than a flag:
`sleeperGet` throws on a 404, `sleeperGetOptional` folds it — reach for the
second only where an absent resource is an answer the caller can act on.

**Never default a season from `DEFAULT_SEASON`.** It is a release note disguised
as a string; call `getActiveSeason()`. An *explicitly requested* season
(`?season=2024`) must never go through the resolver — it is the caller's answer,
and routes reading it stay deterministic. `parseRequestedSeason` in
`shared/season` is where that rule lives: it validates with `isPlausibleSeason`,
the same predicate the resolver accepts Sleeper's answer with, so "looks like a
season" has one spelling. It returns **three** states, not two — `null` means
"not asked" and is the only one the caller fills from `getActiveSeason()`.
Collapsing absent and invalid is how `?season=abc` quietly becomes the current
season.

It lives in `shared/` rather than beside a route because it used to live beside
one, in `app/api/user/[username]/manager-request.ts`, where `npm test` could not
reach it — and where a helper returning six fields for a caller that read one
cost every request an `await getActiveSeason()` it discarded. A route that needs
no season should not pay a Sleeper round-trip for one.

### Known drift

`sleeper/limiter.ts` is a **narrow** port. TheLabX's also carries an admission
half — `tryAcquire` for callers that shed rather than queue, `AbortSignal` and
`maxWaitMs` bounds on the wait, and the `AdmissionAbortedError` /
`AdmissionTimeoutError` pair that lets a caller tell a refusal from failed work.
Every one of those serves something this app has not ported yet (a streaming
leagues route holding a response open, a request budget, advisory-locked syncs).
Bring that half over with the route that needs it; the FIFO queue here is the
part it builds on and is faithful, including the slot *transfer* in `release()`
that keeps the bound from widening across the microtask gap.

`sleeper/types/sleeper.types.ts` doc comments still cite `SLEEPER_DATA_BASE` and
`manager/crawl-ttl`, which arrive with the projections and crawler ports. Twelve
of its fourteen types have no reader yet, and that is deliberate: it is the
ported schema-of-record, and re-transcribing an API by hand is the expensive
half. `Tool` was trimmed the other way, to the five fields anything consumes —
`icon`, `pattern`, `group` and `browses` were set and never read, and re-adding
a field is cheap.

`peekActiveSeason` and `resetActiveSeason` likewise have no caller. Both are
kept: the first carries the argument for why it is *not* a cheaper
`getActiveSeason`, which is the part a reader would otherwise get wrong.

**Untested, and the three worth knowing about.** `sleeper/limiter.ts`,
`season/resolve.ts` and `user/memoize-manager-lookup.ts` all hold decisions that
are silent when wrong — the slot transfer across the microtask gap, the failure
backoff that deliberately does not re-stamp the cache, the rejection eviction
that makes a 502 immediately retryable — and all three take their clock and
their upstream as arguments specifically so they can be tested without either.
`http.test.ts` is the shape to copy.

## Theme

Two schemes, one set of markup, and `globals.css` is the whole of it: tokens on
`:root`, a `prefers-color-scheme: dark` block that moves them, and `@theme
inline` mapping them into Tailwind's namespace.

**`inline` is load-bearing.** A plain `@theme` bakes its value into every
generated utility, so `text-foreground` would resolve once at build time and no
`:root` override could move it afterwards. `inline` emits `var(--foreground)` at
each use site instead and lets the cascade do it. (This reverses an earlier note
here arguing for plain `@theme` on the grounds that nothing indirected any more.
Supporting a second scheme is what made the indirection earn its place.)

Two rules for adding to it:

- **Write alphas over `--color-foreground`, not literal colours.**
  `bg-foreground/[0.04]` and `border-foreground/12` are what make one card read
  correctly in both schemes — a translucent dark tint on a light ground and a
  translucent light tint on a dark one are the same glass.
- **Anything that must name a colour becomes a token.** The header scrim, the
  card shadow, the accent glow and the error text are all `var(--…)` in the
  class string for exactly this reason: an `rgba()` typed into a Tailwind
  arbitrary value cannot invert.

**The accent is two colours, deliberately.** `#00ffe5` is ~15:1 on the dark
ground and ~1.3:1 on white, and it is used as *text*. Light mode gets a teal
(`#0b6d63`, ~5.2:1). Watch alphas on it — `text-active/80` drops the light-mode
label below AA, which is why the account heading uses full opacity.

`--font-display` maps `--font-geist-sans` from `layout.tsx`, which is the only
face loaded. Geist Mono was loaded too and mapped by nothing; it is gone.

`.lab-anim` marks anything decorative that moves, so the
`prefers-reduced-motion` rule can stop all of it at once. It uses `!important`
because those animations are set inline.
